    Rule:
      1) If TCGplayer and Cardmarket on the same matched card disagree by
         >5x, treat the outlier as bad upstream data (pokemontcg.io often
         reflects a different printing's price under one of the two fields).
         Drop the smaller source and use the other — TCGplayer market is
         usually the more trustworthy daily-updated source for US pricing.
      2) Price = MEDIAN of the remaining non-null sources.
         ebay_max_30d is recorded in `sources` for display but does NOT
         enter the aggregate: it comes from the same 30-day comp set as
         ebay_median_30d, so counting both double-weighted eBay and biased
         the result high.
         - With >=3 sources, a max > 2.5x median is dropped as an outlier
           and the median re-taken over the rest.
         - With exactly 2 sources disagreeing >2.5x AND by more than the
           absolute noise floor ($2), use the LOWER one (their median would
           just split the difference; over-listing eats returns,
           under-listing only eats margin).
         Either correction sets outlier_flag and forces needs_review.
