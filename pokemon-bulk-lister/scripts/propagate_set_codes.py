"""Cross-sheet set-code propagation — UNANIMITY rule.

Same name does NOT mean same printing. A Charizard from Base Set ($1000)
and a Charizard from Pokémon GO ($1) share a name but are functionally
different cards. Naive majority-vote propagation can move cards from a
correct match to a wrong one (real example: this very script previously
moved three correctly-priced common Fuecocos onto a sv8 set_code with
a Cardmarket variant mismatch, inflating their price 100x).

Safe rule for this pass:
  - For each name that appears multiple times, collect set_codes from
    instances where id_confidence ≥ 0.5.
  - If ALL of those confident instances share the SAME set_code,
    propagate it to instances missing one.
  - If there's ANY disagreement (two different set_codes), refuse to
    propagate and flag the unknowns for manual review.

Run:
    python scripts/propagate_set_codes.py [--dry-run]
